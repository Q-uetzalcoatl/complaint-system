Place your assets here:

- cvsu-logo.png  (recommended ~512x512 transparent PNG)
- campus.jpg     (background image of CvSU campus, landscape orientation)

Paths referenced by the app:
- Public form: index.php uses assets/campus.jpg as background and assets/cvsu-logo.png as logo.
- Tracking page: track.php uses assets/campus.jpg as background.
- Admin: admin/login.php and admin/dashboard.php use ../assets/campus.jpg as background.

You can replace these anytime without changing code as long as the filenames stay the same.
